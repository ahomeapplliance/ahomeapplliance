Our Mission is to reduce plastic waste pollution in the community, as well as globally, by helping to recycling plastic waste, while also spreading educational awareness about the effects that plastic waste pollution has on our surrounding environment and ecosystems. 

In turn, we will also be creating a small workspace where we can work on our recycling projects to turn plastic waste into reusable items such as, bowls, planters, phone cases, and much, much more. We can produce almost anything you can imagine, while also making piece of art as well!  All creations will then be sold locally and around the world (online) to help support our workspace, plastic pickup, recycling bins, and anything else needed etc. We also promise to always donate 25% of yearly sales to funding plastic waste pollution nonprofits, plastic waste solutions, plastics waste management, and environmental conservation.

We want the future generations to understand the importance of waste reduction locally and around the globe.We will be hosting beach, park, and pinellas trail cleanups as well as a few local fundraisers in the near future.
